title: Difficulties
---

The seed generator supports to play at varying difficulties. This means the logic also has to describe paths for all the difficulties individually.

Currently 4 difficulties are available:

- moki
- gorlek
- kii
- unsafe

Judging the difficulty of a path is often hard. If you're not sure whether a path fits the difficulty you're writing for, don't hesitate to ask in the [Development Discord](https://discord.gg/cMJJ8E3eqH).

To get some guidelines on the existing difficulties, you can check the [Difficulty Wiki Page](https://wiki.orirando.com/seedgen/paths#difficulty).
