title: Regions
---

We split the world up into regions, mostly to organize pathfinders.

Most anchors are named after the naming scheme `region.anchor`, which is why many anchor names start the same way.

These are the regions we came up with:

- MarshSpawn
- HowlsDen
- MarshPastOpher
- MidnightBurrows
- WestHollow
- EastHollow
- GladesTown
- WestGlades
- OuterWellspring
- InnerWellspring
- WoodsEntry
- WoodsMain
- LowerReach
- UpperReach
- UpperDepths

- PoolsApproach
- EastPools
- UpperPools
- WestPools
- LowerWastes
- UpperWastes
- WeepingRidge
