title: Language Extension
---

It is recommended to use the text editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work on the logic file.

This is optional, but we have an extension for Visual Studio Code that will help you.

## Installing the extension

- Download and install Visual Studio Code from the link above
- Download the latest version of the extension (logic-language-\*\*\*\*\*.vsix): [Logic Extension Releases](https://github.com/ori-community/wotw-logic-language/releases)
  (There are no autoupdates, if you are getting errors while viewing the logic file, try updating to the latest version from here)
- In Visual Studio Code, within the icons on the left, open "Extensions" (or try `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
- In the Extensions menu, open the three dots at the top right
- Select "Install from VSIX..."
  (If you can't find this, alternatively try pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then enter "vsix" and select the result "Extensions: Install from VSIX...")
- Select the \*.vsix file you downloaded earlier
- In the bottom right, you should get a prompt with a button "Reload Now", use it.
  (Alternatively, you can also restart Visual Studio Code manually)

## Using the extension

If the installation was successful, you shouldn't have to do anything more. When working on the logic file, everything should now be color coded to make it easier to read, and if you write any incorrect syntax, it should mark the mistake and hovering that should give you an error message.

If you can't figure out how to fix an error, you can post about it in the [Development Discord](https://discord.gg/cMJJ8E3eqH)

A full list of the features can be viewed in the extension's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ori-community/wotw-logic-language)
