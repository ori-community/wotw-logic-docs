We have a couple seeds that can be convenient to play on while working on the logic file.

To use them, follow the Link for a given seed, then save the file (usually `Ctrl+S`). You can put the downloaded file anywhere you want, double clicking it will launch the randomizer with that seed.

## Pathfinder Helper

Link: [pathfinderhelper.wotwr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ori-community/toolseeds/main/_pathfinderhelper.wotwr)

This is the seed that most Pathfinders actively work with. It has several features useful for Pathfinding:

- Spawn with all abilities and resources
- Adds a warp icon for each logical anchor. If you press your bind to display icon labels in the map, it will show all the anchor names
- `Ctrl+1` to turn Clean Water on or off
- `Ctrl+2` to warp to a set of coordinates. You can edit the seed file with a text editor to change the target coordinates
- `Ctrl+3` to refill your Health and Energy to full and place a Checkpoint
- `Ctrl+4` to reset the world state, close all doors, unpull all levers etc. (might have to kill yourself to have everything work correctly again)
- `Ctrl+5` to switch between difficulties

(You can rebind these in the randomizer settings)

## Pickup Names

Link: [pickupnames.wotwr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ori-community/toolseeds/main/_pickupnames.wotwr)

If you load this seed and then press your bind to show Labels in the in-game map, it will show all the pickup names as used in the logic file above each pickup
